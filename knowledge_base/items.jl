First of all let me start off by saying that I can not 100% guarantee the accuracy of this information however I don't really think anyone can without working at Google for several years. So let's start off with what a \"less secure app\" is, it is any app that google can NOT popup a window like the one seen in the second to the bottom image to truly verify you are who you say you are with either, an alternate email, a phone, or the google auth app. Outlook is a really good example it does not allow these popups to exist so therefore is marked as an less secure app. Don't get this confused with an unsecure app which will not work at all with Google as far as I know, these do not communicate over ssl  AT ALL and instead use plain text auth which can easily be copied and stolen. Now how the auth process works (again as far as I know) When a Google gets a request from let's say Outlook 2010 on the IP address of 8.8.8.8 (This would never auctually be the ip it would get but you get the point). Now Google knows that this is a \"less secure app\" and therefore will deny the request EVEN IF THE EMAIL AND PASS ARE CORRECT. Now let's take Mozilla Thunderbird it connects to Google at that same IP address of 8.8.8.8 now Google knows this app supports its popup auth window and sends Mozilla Thunderbird the request to open the window with a onetime unique url generated by google the user signs in and uses let's say a phone and gets the text puts in the good (which is correct) Google will now check the code is correct, sees that it is correct and accepts the request. Now Note that there is far more involved and that you will be always forced to auth on the web site if your ip is new to google. I hope that this clears it up at least a little, and if someone knows more about this than I do feel free to edit this and make it more detailed and accurate.", "Now personally I have had this on for years and never once had a problem but I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU ACCOUNT IS HACKED BECAUSE OF THIS!", "I never could get Outlook to work despite all the wonderful help.
