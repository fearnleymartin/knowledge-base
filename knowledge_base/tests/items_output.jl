Every time I try to restore it in iTunes I get error 9. Any tips on fixing it? I've gotten a new phone since, because the 6 was already having battery and touch screen problems, but it would be nice to have it as a backup. Second, my dad is trying to get music on his iPhone 7. For some reason, he's never synced it to his computer, and whenever I connect it to iTunes it is seen as a new iPhone. The only options are to restore it from a backup of his iPhone 4 from like three years ago or set it up as a new iPhone. Are there any workarounds for this?

Battery charged on to the equivalent of 65% at full though, they tore the ribbon that goes from touchid, so they put the screen and touchid from the other phone on this one till they get a new ribbon in.

It takes multiple clicks of the home and/or power button to get it back on My problem is that it's freezing after being off for a few minutes with no use.

To make sure your data is being saved in the backup you will need to look at your backup settings inside the Settings app where it breaks down each app's data that is being backed up. The default when you install a new app is for it to be turned on though so unless you switched it off on purpose it should be backing up. I'd check anyway though. share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Link Like + Quote Reply", 'author_link': 'https://forums.macrumors.com/members/eyoungren.612797/', 'author': 'eyoungren'}, {'date': datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 19, 0, 0), 'body': '#5 Thank you!

There is no way you're getting any 3.5mm headphones to fit enough to receive audio in this thing, literally broke my headphones just pushing them straight in there which was poor judgement to follow this advice. I understand there is a lightning cable connector you can buy, but honestly, seriously? did apple actually make an iPhone 6 plus that doesn't fit the standard headphones that so many people have? it makes no sense to me. I looked into possibilities of it being a knock off ect. and its the real deal. Someone said maybe there is a screw in there, there isnt. But why would there be anyway? other people mention crackling issues related to this version. But I feel like the only person with a jack that simply fits no standard headphones not even apples. Any advice? is this intentional or normal. Before you mention it: There is NO room to budge. You are not getting these headphones a nudge further then they are here.

As far as Do Not Disturb, there are only options for calls.

Like other platforms, the game costs $39.99 [Direct Link] and tasks players with deciphering hundreds of puzzles set on a mysterious island. Since its release early last year the game has received critical acclaim for its puzzle design, graphics, and secrets-filled backstory. The macOS version ports the same game and experience over to Apple computers running macOS 10.11.6 or later with 4GB of RAM and 5GB available storage space. The game also requires Apple's new Metal graphics technology to run. You wake up, alone, on a strange island full of puzzles that will challenge and surprise you. You don't remember who you are, and you don't remember how you got here, but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home. The Witness is a single-player game in an open world with dozens of locations to explore and over 500 puzzles. This game respects you as an intelligent player and it treats your time as precious. There's no filler; each of those puzzles brings its own new idea into the mix. So, this is a game full of ideas. An iOS port of the game has long been in development, and a few developers at Thekla -- the game's creators -- mentioned in passing recently that the game is still being worked on for iOS, but a launch date is unspecified. Since The Witness is so graphically intensive, the iOS port will require a longer gestation to pare down the visuals in order to run properly on Apple's smartphones and tablets. The Witness is available today for $39.99 on the Mac App Store [Direct Link].

WebAssembly allows complex apps, like games, to run faster than ever before in a web browser. We expect that WebAssembly will enable applications that have historically been too complex to run fast in browsers â\x80\x93 like immersive 3D video games, computer-aided design, video and image editing, and scientific visualization.

In addition to Web Assembly, the update adds automatic detection of "captive portals" often used by hotel wifi networks that require the user to log in before they can access the web.

The models that Apple discontinued support for are mostly for their rather obsolete Apple Display Connector type that came out with the G4 PowerMac line.

The following is a crosspost from the Apple Forum - just in case someone like me did the trick, losing both brightness sliders due to cache and PRAM: I can confirm that this solution brought back the missing functionality - thanks a lot for sharing this information. To whom it may concern: the first time I tried this hack, BOTH monitors lacked the brightness slider, even after copying back the original 10.9 ktext files!

If he finds Spy B, that player is insta-killed. Bad guys: Alpha WW (President) as usual. Eats the good guys. Normal WW as usual. No special. Spy Black (Put-it-in) He wants to expose Spy White (Alex). Scans a player at night-time. If he finds Spy White that player is insta-killed. If the Alpha is lynched Spy Black can choose another player to take that role - but if he choses Spy White the good guys win. If Spy White and Spy Black find each other in the same night, they both die. @ravenvii ok that way? please clarify whether the "spies" (Alex and Put-it-in) can PM with their respective team or not. thx', 'author_link': 'https://forums.macrumors.com/members/211005/', 'author': '@Scepticalscribe'}, {'date': datetime.datetime(2011, 1, 1, 0, 0), 'body': 'AlliFlowers Contributor Joined: Jan 1, 2011 Location: L.A.

The Soviet union didn\'t just miraculously appear but one should keep in mind that the Warsaw Pact was formed after NATO. Most non communist have always been terrified of Russia and the Soviet Union. These days it\'s the far right who is flirting with Putin since the rise of fascism. Maybe it would have been a good idea to have dissolved NATO after the collapse of the Eastern Block. There would have been more reasons to form European defense forces that wouldn\'t have been tied to US forces during the wars in the Middle East. And, if Sweden hadn\'t ditched their nuclear weapons program during the 70\'s the situation would be totally different in Scandinavia. I\'m wondering how happy the Ukrainian people are that they gave all the nukes away to Russia... Naturally not all are fit to do military service. We used to have options to make a "pacifist" service in the fire brigades and such. But someone not having proper discharge papers from the military was considered odd. And employers actually looked at the military rekommendations in addition to civil education. And I don\'t know... 15 months should be enough for most units, unless they are very specialized...and in those cases it\'s not so strange having career staff manning the jets or such. --- Post Merged, Mar 10, 2017 at 1:53 PM --- vrDrew said:  It would, in my opinion, be a better policy for Sweden to increase the attractiveness of service in it\'s military: Better pay; more educational and career opportunities.

I\'m sorry, but I simply don\'t see the attractiveness in doing military service unless you get some massive incentive to do it. In Sweden education is free all the way into university level and healthcare is all tax funded.

Indeed a lot of young men benefited from being taught how to make their bed and not putting their own needs first. Being able to see yourself as a cog in a machine and be taught how to care for your comrades is nothing to frown at. Not totally sure how this would be a Democrat killer though.

Well, you darn Swedes have gone and messed things up by making your country such a good place to live! You bring up a good point about education.

Though, doesn\'t Russia have a conscription system? Not sure Russia can be called a superpower of course. Seems what you are describing is either a really bad case of horrid organisation or really poor conscription material. Perhaps it depends on what kind of unit you serve in as well. When I did the service there were people that shouldn\'t have been there in the first place, but they had a tendency to be sorted out. All in all I thought it was a well balanced mix of different people. I do agree that the validity of the conscription system falters when not everyone is obligated to serve and the citizens are no longer expected to protect the society in which they are living. Since we pay taxes one could argue we have already paid our dues to the system and therefore are bot required to do any further service. And if the bulk of the personell is made up by drone pilots, the point in conscription is also sort of moot. share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Link Like + Quote Reply', 'author_link': 'https://forums.macrumors.com/members/niploteksi.1061512/', 'author': 'niploteksi'}, {'date': datetime.datetime(2014, 9, 24, 0, 0), 'body': 'lowendlinux Contributor Joined: Sep 24, 2014 Location: ~ #34 I think conscription and the draft are generally bad ideas. share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Link Like + Quote Reply', 'author_link': 'https://forums.macrumors.com/members/lowendlinux.920105/', 'author': 'lowendlinux'}]}

I would say the best course of action would be contacting Customer care in your country and explaining them the situation. They will probably change your password for updates so a subsequent re-activation of your ESET product with your license key (found only in the registration email you should have received after purchase) will download the new U/P and thus prevent other installations from updating. 0 Share this post Link to post Share on other sites", 'author_link': 'https://forum.eset.com/profile/10-marcos/', 'author': 'Marcos'}]}

I'm DWomack and I've been with ESET since 2009. I started out working in Customer Care-Home Support and last July became the first (and so far only) Online Community Specialist at ESET North America. I was part of the awesome team that helped create the forums and I'm excited about helping all our users and prospective users here and one all our social networks. At home I have two main laptop I use running Win7 on one and Win8 on the other. I have ESS v6 running on the Win8 and I'm testing EAV v7 Beta on Win7. Interesting fact, I am an out-of-practice musician (multiple instruments but mostly trumpet and guitar) and singer. I'm out of practice only in that I haven't picked up the trumpet in about 8 years and I don't pick up the guitar as much as I'd like to.

On the assumption that I\'m now supposed to get information and help here rather than at Wilders, I wandered around this Eset Security Forum, but didn\'t find someplace where I could start a new thread to ask some questions. So I will take the liberty of doing that here. A few minutes ago, from Eset\'s website (hxxp://www.eset.com/us/download/thank-you-eav/file/8651/) I downloaded an offline Eset NOD32 v6.something. Its title is eav_nt64_enu.msi and its size is 55.5 MB (58,256,384 bytes). Given the weird title (although I am used to .msi installation files), I am not completely confident that I downloaded the offline 64-bit version. (The 64 in nt64 probably means 64-bit, but "64-bit" or "64bit" would have been more comforting.) If anyone reading this can confirm that my download is what I want (NOD32 v6.x appropriate for 64-bit Win7sp1), I would very much appreciate getting that information before I install eav_nt64_enu.msi. Thanks for any comments, suggestions, help, or a confirmation! R.N.

And the most interesting is, that when it is explained, most of them, ....them I know of...., begins to use it. The small amount of feedback that I have, is that most people thinks, in the beginning, that it is a little bit awkward. But like many things, it is just a question about learning new habits.

Thank you ESET I agree with Janus, that many users are unaware, or have not been introduced to the technology. We need more colaborative efforts in spreading the word and making users aware about current day treats and possibilities. On average, once a week i find myself having a discussion with clients about what security measures they are taking, and why they chose what they chose. My topic leads to types of attacks and exploits that the client did not know existed or was possible, quoting " I thought that was in the movies ". We need to let people know that a strong authentication process is paramount when running online activities such as money routing and transactions, including online banking and purchasing products as well as logging into personal accounts or web portals that contain sensitive personal information. 2 Factor checking provides that extra added security for when the first is compromised, the second prevails, and also adds another step for people with malicious intent.

You enter your normal username and password to login to a server or website, and before it lets you proceed you must enter a second password to get in. ESET helps out with this by providing a mobile app that goes on your smart phone. After you pass the first username and password, it asks for another password that only can be retrieved or sent to your phone. This prevents anyone who has stolen your password to login at all because they will not have your phone to get the second password. This is the easiest way i can explain it.

(My excuse is a long boring story.) I very much appreciate your explanation of Two-Factor Authentication, and the hxxp://www.eset.com/us/business/products/secure-authentication/ link. That link made me realize that I can use Two-Factor Authentication on internet websites, but that Two-Factor Authentication is not appropriate for my end of internet connections. I do some economics consulting (mostly I am retired), but my communications with clients are by voice (in person or by land-line At&T telephone) or email. I don\'t have a website, much less a business website. For someone who has two cellphones (neither qualifying as a smart cellphone; they are roughly ten years old), I am a weirdo. Each cellphone lives in an automobile, and is used very occasionally, and only for talking. Consequently no one calls me using my cellphone numbers, because if they happened to call me on one of my cellphones (probably only my wife and me know the number; it\'s written on the back of the phone), I would eventually hear it, probably weeks later. Nevertheless, your description of how to use a smart cellphone for Two-Factor Authentication was interesting. Someday I may get a smartphone, and I am happy to know about the Eset\'s mobile app. Related different issue: I am trying to improve the security of my home office (and of using a computer when in a hotel) by installing a Virtual Private Network. When using Windows 2000 and XP, my own favorite VPN was WiFiConsulting\'s hxxp://hotspotvpn.com/, and it provided excellent protection. But I found it impossible for me to install successfully (after what I think of as trying for 100 hours or more, due to useless correspondence with WiFiConsulting) on my new Windows7 sp1 64-bit laptop, because my requests for assistance got incomplete and/or generalized answers that weren\'t specific enough for a non-geek economist (me). So I gave up. Over the past week I have been considering other VPN providers, and I tentatively have settled on Private Internet Access. I had a "chat" with one of their representatives, and asked whether Private Internet Access would interfere with Eset, or vice versa. Unfortunately he hadn\'t heard of Eset. But he said that there were some cases where security software interfered with Virtual Private Access. If any Eset user knows of any conflicts between Eset NOD32 version 7.x and Private Internet Access, please let me know. I will come back to this page in a day or so. R.N.

The rest of this post is to let you and anyone else interested to know about some interesting VPNs. Private Internet Access is a VPN company\'s name. Annual cost: $40. It\'s "Home" website is at https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/ To get more information click on the other columns there. The most useful one (my opinion) is Contact Us, which is a collection of FAQs. Each one is separate, so I for my own use I created an "open" collection by copying each FAQ into Thornsoft\'s ClipMate, and then pasting them into Mozilla-SeaMonkey\'s HTML Composer. Some interesting reviews of Private Internet Access are: PCMagazine, at hxxp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414799,00.asp FreedomHacker, at hxxp://freedomhacker.net/private-internet-access-vpn-review/ An alternative is VikingVPN, $120 annual cost. Website is https://vikingvpn.com/ As nearly as I can see, it\'s only disadvantage is expense. But my recollection is that roughly $120 is what I paid when I was using WiFiConsulting\'s hxxp://hotspotvpn.com/, so that price isn\'t unreasonable. And it might be simpler to use than Private Internet Access is. For a very favorable review of Viking VPN, see FreedomHacker, at hxxp://freedomhacker.net/vikingvpn-review/ The prices I mention above are rounded up to the nearest dollar. Some of my efforts to decide what VPN to use are at Windows Secrets Lounge, at hxxp://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/163638-Virtual-Private-Network-%28VPN%29-Choices Roger P.S. I also considered ExpressVPN at https://www.express-vpn.com/?a_aid=zpeti, with a favorable review at https://www.bestvpn.com/blog/9405/expressvpn_review/ But my wife and I use only laptops; I don\'t use ExpressVPN\'s capabilities for multiple devices.

(I already knew about openvpn, because apparently is the foundation for many Virtual Private Networks, including WiFiConsulting\'s hxxp://hotspotvpn.com/ when I hadn\'t yet moved from WinXP to Windows7 and could not manage to install it on my Windows7 laptop.) But vpnsecure.me has an interesting note on its website: "Dedicated IP\'s are separate plans at a different price to our $9.95 shared IP plans, however are shown above as available for use with OpenVPN only. Choose your dedicated IP package under the OpenVPN & PPTP drop down in the checkout." I think I understand that IP stands for Internet Protocol, but I don\'t know what a Dedicated IP is. Dedicated to what? I have posed that question on vpnsecure.me\'s website, and I hope I get an answer by email. Thanks for the information. R.N.

The site creates a web portal for everyone who wants to explore the online universe, upload interesting content and contribute to curating content for their fellow web surfers.GoExplore.net will offer exclusive interviews with high-profile Internet celebrities, how-tos, infographics and videos, as well as surveys and poll results.“Our new site, GoExplore.net, celebrates the very best of the web. We’re excited to connect with people who want to check out life beyond the first page of search and contribute to the content that’s featured for others to enjoy,” said Ignacio Sbampato, chief sales and marketing officer, ESET. “Our mission at ESET is to help people to enjoy safer technology. Our security software helps to protect customers and allows them to explore the Internet free from interruptions and malware, knowing their data is safer. We’d like to invite everyone who loves the web to become a member of the GoExplore.net community.”Recent research by GoExplore.net, revealed some interesting findings when it comes to consumer web surfing behavior. In a survey of 2,000 people in the United States and Great Britain, GoExplore.net uncovered the risks people take when surfing the web, as well as surprising behavioral differences between the sexes.According to GoExplore.net’s research, almost a quarter of American men (23.1 percent) ages 25-34 admit to using the Internet while driving a vehicle, compared to seven percent of their British counterparts. British female drivers in the same age range are twice as likely (14.3 percent) to be surfing behind the wheel.Other GoExplore.net findings include:Americans are almost three times (2.8 percent) as likely to use their smartphones at a funeral or religious service than Brits, with American women being seven times as likely to surf at a service than British women.10 percent of Internet users say they find it difficult to find what they want on the net.12.3 percent of American men ages 25-34 say they risk taking their smartphone with them to the shower or bath.About GoExplore.netGoExplore.net is an Internet initiative from security firm ESET.

And i consider myself reasonably technically proficient in MOST things. But this problem has me stumped due to (for the most part) lack of decent instructions or guidance to be found online. I am attempting to build a form for use by the employees at my company to track "signatures". we have up to now been using manually signed forms for this purpose. my goal is to go paperless with this process. I know this can be done because the Air Force (my customer) is using a form that allows you to do something similar (see here: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd2875.pdf). The before listed form allows you to "click" on the signature block and add your digital signature (which for the AF comes from a ID card). let me explain the dev environment i am using / testing on: Creating the form:I am using my personal laptop with my own personal copy of Adobe Pro 9. I have no dig signatures installed or any capacity to use them on this system. I CAN however add the field for the sig when creating the form and the field responds when clicked, although with a different prompt than the 2875 (i think this may be part of the issue). I then have tried sending the form to my AF computer to test out if it will actually allow me to add a signature block. Testing the form:On my AF computer I only have adobe reader 9 installed, and it will allow me to add my sig to the DD 2875. When i bring up my newly created form with my added sig field nothing happens at ALL when you click on it. Troubleshooting:I first noticed that under the form properties the security was set up to NOT allow signing. I changed this and sent it back over from one system to another, and it seems in the translation it loses that setting. I first assumed it might be due to the security the AF places on its email servers. So in response i burned the form to a cd and manually transferred it but recieved the same result. Conclusion:I am woefully undereducated on PDF development i suspect to understand all of what is happening here but i have a feeling there is some script attached to the AF form that works that allows it to function properly. If that is the case I am not sure what recourse i have, if any. BUT, if its something simple that im just missing because of my inexperience I am hoping someone on here can lend me a hand.

The other way is to use Acrobat Pro (I know you said you have Pro, but for anyone else reading this has has Acrobat Standard, that version doesn\'t have the Reader Enable functionality). With the file you\'ve been working on open in Acrobat select the Advanced > Extend Features in Adobe Reader menu item.

I have had my Dell Latitude E6420 for about 5 years now but i haven't used it for about a year, It's been locked away. I decided to get it out and running again to use as a work laptop something that is easy to carry around. I hit the power button and started up fine all was running like it should, as you could imagine i had loads of updates available one was the option to update to windows 10 from the original windows 7 system. Since i have done the update to Windows 10 there is just problem after problem. My laptop keeps freezing at random points i could be doing next to nothing or i could have the laptop doing 300 activities and it will freeze either way, so i have to force shutdown the laptop by holding the power button. Then when turning on again my laptop isn't detecting my wireless mouse so i have to shutdown the laptop and turn it on again for it to pick up the mouse. Finally the speakers/sound card keeps not wanting to work without me troubleshooting the volume icon first, and then might only let me use the headphones or the speakers (volume 100% speakers don't work, put head phones in, they work. This can also happen the opposite way round speakers on 100% and work, plug headphones in, don't work???) I have something i have to mess around with everyday without a doubt. I need some software for sale or downloadable either way to fix these problems i am having with Windows 10 unless it's my computer. I will place the specs below they might help. SPECS Model: Dell Latitude E6420 RAM: 4GB Hard Drive: 1TB Processor: Intel core i5 vpro Year: Roughly 2009 If there are any more specs you need just let me know and i will add them on.

If not, it may be hardware failing - for example the freezing could be associated with processor fans getting clogged with dust, in which case a good internal clean (c/o your local computer shop, possilbly?) may help.

Dell Product Support The important part of this page is in the top middle about 6" or 15cm down. Product not tested for Windows 10 upgrade. First, your device is SEVEN years old. 2016 - 2009 = 7 . Ok, you may have a late 2009 so it may be 6 years and 10 months old. I would suggest you do a Factory Default on the laptop and put it back to the original operating system (I assume it was Windows 7) as you may find it doesn\'t like Windows 8.1 much either. I found this with a Dell Vostro of the same year. Yes, different hardware but same warning on their support page about a Windows 10 upgrade. If you decide to restore to Factory Default, I have the link below for you. Just be aware that the Upgrades shall take some time and will add up. I did a clean install of Windows 7 with SP1 slipstreamed and Windows 10 SP1 and there were about 352 or more Updates and 3,400+MB. If you get a couple of hundred Updates to do, do not do them all in one hit. I have had many of them fail and then spend hours (well almost) waiting for them to be removed on the reboot. Chunks of 20 or so at a time seemed to work best and reboot after each install, even if they fail. Work from the top of the Update list and go down.

I just replaced a mechanical drive on a 2 year old laptop with a 500GB SSD, installed Windows 8.1 and after all software was installed, boot was 11 seconds and shutdown was 3, yes THREE seconds from click Shutdown until all lights off.

I have an 8 year old Acer and Windows 10 runs surprisingly well on it however not all old gear likes Win10. There was a Sony Viao that the Windows Upgrade tool said "yep bubba, load it on" but the Sony support site said they were NOT making Windows 10 drivers for that model. The result was Windows 10 would install but half the hardware didn\'t have drivers. This is not an uncommon story. Woodward, if you have the time to spare try a clean install. Who knows, it might work. I would suggest a different HDD so you don\'t wipe out the Recovery Partition that is on your present HDD. Buy the wife something nice so you can justify the SSD to install in it. If it doesn\'t work then a $10 USB 3 enclosure will make a nice fast backup device for the new laptop you are considering and that will have USB3.1 SS. Backup from SSD to SSD enclosure will be mighty quick. Woodward, one last link for you to read if you want Windows 10. Stop Windows 10 Telemetry Even Windows Explorer (note, NOT Internet Explorer) has it\'s own "phone home" line. Now why would it need that?

Replaced double by float. This is much faster on most graphics cards. This is not possible if you really need the double precision. Often that's not the case though. Save the sum in a temporary variable sum before writing it into the array y which is located in global memory. Accesses to global memory are very expensive, try to avoid them whenever possible. These are a few tips that might help you to speed up your code on the GPU. Finding the Optimal Block Size What also has an impact on performance is the block size.

Which looks to me quite optimal, I tried also other chunk sizes, like 32 and 64, but then it resembling regular loop more, while 16 exhausts the xmm registers for vectorizing the chunk by unrolling it completely. (of course adjust -march to your actual CPU, so the executable will work. I was just trying out whether the vectorizing on high-end works as expected). Here is code I used to test the validity of the code above: int main() { constexpr int width = 40, height = 20; double testX[width*height], testY[width] = {0}; double* tXptr = testX; for (int y = 0; y < height; ++y) { for (int x = 0; x < width; ++x) { *tXptr = (y <= x) ? 1+x : 0; ++tXptr; } } // print testX for verification for (int y = 0; y < height; ++y) { for (int x = 0; x < width; ++x) std::cout << testX[y*width + x] << " "; std::cout << "\\n"; } std::cout << "Y before:\\n"; for (int x = 0; x < width; ++x) std::cout << testY[x] << " "; std::cout << "\\n"; Accumulate(testX, testY, height, width); std::cout << "Y after first Accumulate:\\n"; for (int x = 0; x < width; ++x) std::cout << testY[x] << " "; std::cout << "\\n"; Accumulate(testX, testY, height, width); std::cout << "Y after second Accumulate:\\n"; for (int x = 0; x < width; ++x) std::cout << testY[x] << " "; std::cout << "\\n"; } Please, I would appreciate any profiling/measures in real life of this, how it stands against your original CUDA implementation (this is single CPU core, but can be spread to multiple threads by chunks quite easily, although I\'m not sure how much the CPU will recognize the memory access patterns are not colliding, maybe I would use several chunks per core, so core0 would do first 10 chunks of columns, core1 chunks 11..20, etc.. so each thread would start well apart of each other). I would love to hear how old CPU (with "good code" according to me ;) ) is holding up against CUDA with yours original version, just to get idea how powerful those GPUs are. Thank you (if it doesn\'t take too much time to do some profiling). EDIT: What I did, I simply process several values from the same row at the same time ("chunk") into local sum variable, and at the end I add that to y. And I avoid any multiplication/division/modulus in addressing the x/y memory and overall give the compiler chance to understand what is going on, so it can optimize aggressively. If "chunk" size would be 4, and your data would be 10x4, this is the order of accessing memory of x: 1111555599 22226666AA 33337777BB 44448888CC', 'author_link': 'http://stackoverflow.com/users/4271923/ped7g', 'author': 'Ped7g'}]}

I\'m fairly new to Microsoft Dynamics 365 and have a question about \'My Apps\'. I would like to change the name "Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service" to "Field Service" since this is not really visible in this screen: I\'ve tried to change it in \'Settings\' > \'My Apps\'. Which gave me this result in \'My Apps\': But when I look at my Home screen and Dynamics 365 screen nothing changes. Even after I hit the Sync-button. Is there a solution to change this name? Thanks in advance!
