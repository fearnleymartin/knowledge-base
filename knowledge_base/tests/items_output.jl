Every time I try to restore it in iTunes I get error 9. Any tips on fixing it? I've gotten a new phone since, because the 6 was already having battery and touch screen problems, but it would be nice to have it as a backup. Second, my dad is trying to get music on his iPhone 7. For some reason, he's never synced it to his computer, and whenever I connect it to iTunes it is seen as a new iPhone. The only options are to restore it from a backup of his iPhone 4 from like three years ago or set it up as a new iPhone. Are there any workarounds for this?

To make sure your data is being saved in the backup you will need to look at your backup settings inside the Settings app where it breaks down each app's data that is being backed up. The default when you install a new app is for it to be turned on though so unless you switched it off on purpose it should be backing up. I'd check anyway though. share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Link Like + Quote Reply", 'author_link': 'https://forums.macrumors.com/members/eyoungren.612797/'}, {'date': datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 19, 0, 0), 'author': 'bagongo', 'body': '#5 Thank you!

For the first 15 minutes or so, it sits comfortably at 100% during use. Then it starts counting down rapidly, practically free-falling to some number between 85 and 95 before pausing there for quite a while. You can watch the indicator losing 1% every 5 seconds or so. This plummet-levitate-plummet-levitate thing (the rapid drops come in 10-15% sized chunks) keeps going until it\'s down to 1%. Then it keeps running for hours on this supposed "1%" before eventually shutting down. I mean that quite literally; I\'ve had it run for up to 4 hours with 1% left (4 hrs of usage, not standby). You\'d think that after showing it the true scope of its battery capacity, the phone would go "OMG! It\'s THAT much more than I projected? Wow. Thanks for alerting me to the huge power stash hidden under 1%. I will calibrate accordingly." Except it doesn\'t learn anything. It will be exactly as clueless after a calibration as it was before it. The "normal" battery wear level reported by Coconut Battery (and Battery Life) is around 12% (88% of original capacity) - the phone is 17 months old - but once the free-falling is in progress, Battery Life will report anything from "VERY BAD - 70% wear level" to "BAD - 23% wear level". Battery Life will keep fluctuating between crappy orange and disaster red, and I won\'t see lime green ("AVERAGE - 12% wear level") until it\'s down to 1% again. If I reboot the phone at a time when the battery level appears unreasonably low, I often find that it magically regains 20 or so percent after restarting. What was 43% is now suddenly 65%, then it starts another rapid countdown and settles somewhere around 60% within a minute or two. None of my other iOS devices behave like this. I have an iPhone 5s and an iPad Air that are both 3 years old and they\'re both at over 90% of original capacity, and discharging is stable and predictable. So I took the 6s Plus to an Apple Premium Reseller and the guy there claimed that it was normal behavior for iPhone models 6 and later. I was told the exact same thing by another guy when I called a support line. Well, it can\'t be normal behavior because then the battery indicator is so useless you might as well replace it with an 8-ball. 4 hrs usage on 1% would mean 400 hrs of usage and over 500 days of standby. share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Link Like + Quote Reply', 'author_link': 'https://forums.macrumors.com/members/anuba.47454/'}]}

The malware has been dubbed "DOK" and is being disseminated through an email phishing campaign which researchers at CheckPoint say is specifically targeting macOS users, making it the first of its kind. The malware works by gaining administration privileges in order to install a new root certificate on the user\'s system. This enables it to gain access to all communications between the host Mac and the internet, including traffic flowing through connections encrypted with SSL. The initial email pretends to be informing the recipient of inconsistencies in their tax return and asks them to download a zip file attachment to their Mac that harbors the malware. Apple\'s built-in Gatekeeper security feature reportedly fails to recognize it as a threat because of its valid developer certificate, and the malware copies itself to the /Users/Shared/ folder and creates a login item to make itself persistent, even in a rebooted system. The malware later presents the user with a security message claiming an update is available for the system, for which a password input is required. Following the "update", the malware gains complete control of admin privileges, adjusts the network settings to divert all outgoing connections through a proxy, and installs additional tools that enable it to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on all traffic. According to the researchers, Mac antivirus programs have yet to update their databases to detect the DOK malware, and advises that Apple revoke the developer certificate associated with the author immediately. Back in January, researchers discovered a piece of Mac malware called Fruitfly that successfully spied on computers in medical research centers for years before being detected. The latest discovery of malware, which appears to target predominantly European users, underlines the fact that Macs are not immune to the threat as is sometimes supposed. As always, users should avoid clicking links or downloading attachments in emails from unknown and untrusted sources.Tag: security', 'author_link': 'https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/'}, {'date': datetime.datetime(2017, 4, 26, 6, 17), 'author': 'Joe Rossignol', 'body': 'Tweetbot for Mac has been updated with support for a number of changes that Twitter has introduced in recent months.

The performance upgrades mainly account for optimized speeds that will help creative professionals who capture and transfer heavy loads of high-resolution content. The new G-Drive with Thunderbolt 3 includes dual TB3 ports, a USB-C port, and supports USB 3.1, allowing users to daisy chain as many as five additional devices at once so multiple drives can remain connected, enabling complex workflows through a single connection. The G-Drive with Thunderbolt 3 includes a HGST-brand Ultrastar 7200RPM Enterprise-class hard drive, transfer rates up to 245 Mb/s, and includes the G-Drive line\'s usual Time Machine plug-and-play set-up. The G-Drive with Thunderbolt 3 Users interested can pre-order the G-Drive with Thunderbolt 3 now, and it\'s available with four optional storage capacities: 4TB ($399.95), 6TB ($499.95), 8TB ($599.95), and 10TB ($699.95). An additional 12TB version will debut sometime "next quarter" at $799.95. â\x80\x9cG-Technology recognizes the need for a complete workflow solution that takes advantage of the power of Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C,â\x80\x9d said Sven Rathjen, vice president of marketing, Client Solutions, Western Digital. â\x80\x9cThe result is a substantial upgrade across several product lines that delivers reliable, fast, and easy-to-use storage solutions to fit the current and future needs of our customers.â\x80\x9d Western Digital is also updating its line of high-performance, removable dual-hard drives with the G-Raid with Thunderbolt 3, which features two TB3 ports, one USB-C port, and one HDMI port that is out-of-the-box ready for video running at 60fps in 4K as well as HDR content.

The last of Western Digital\'s updates centers on the company\'s high-performance, transportable 8-bay RAID solution -- which now comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports -- called the G-Speed Shuttle XL. The new unit offers hardware RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, 10, and 50 configurations and comes equipped with G-Technology\'s usual Ultrastar 7200RPM Enterprise-class hard drives, and boasts transfer rates up to 2000 MB/s.

The models that Apple discontinued support for are mostly for their rather obsolete Apple Display Connector type that came out with the G4 PowerMac line.

The Soviet union didn\'t just miraculously appear but one should keep in mind that the Warsaw Pact was formed after NATO. Most non communist have always been terrified of Russia and the Soviet Union. These days it\'s the far right who is flirting with Putin since the rise of fascism. Maybe it would have been a good idea to have dissolved NATO after the collapse of the Eastern Block. There would have been more reasons to form European defense forces that wouldn\'t have been tied to US forces during the wars in the Middle East. And, if Sweden hadn\'t ditched their nuclear weapons program during the 70\'s the situation would be totally different in Scandinavia. I\'m wondering how happy the Ukrainian people are that they gave all the nukes away to Russia... Naturally not all are fit to do military service. We used to have options to make a "pacifist" service in the fire brigades and such. But someone not having proper discharge papers from the military was considered odd. And employers actually looked at the military rekommendations in addition to civil education. And I don\'t know... 15 months should be enough for most units, unless they are very specialized...and in those cases it\'s not so strange having career staff manning the jets or such. --- Post Merged, Mar 10, 2017 --- vrDrew said: ↑ It would, in my opinion, be a better policy for Sweden to increase the attractiveness of service in it\'s military: Better pay; more educational and career opportunities.

Though, doesn\'t Russia have a conscription system? Not sure Russia can be called a superpower of course. Seems what you are describing is either a really bad case of horrid organisation or really poor conscription material. Perhaps it depends on what kind of unit you serve in as well. When I did the service there were people that shouldn\'t have been there in the first place, but they had a tendency to be sorted out. All in all I thought it was a well balanced mix of different people. I do agree that the validity of the conscription system falters when not everyone is obligated to serve and the citizens are no longer expected to protect the society in which they are living. Since we pay taxes one could argue we have already paid our dues to the system and therefore are bot required to do any further service. And if the bulk of the personell is made up by drone pilots, the point in conscription is also sort of moot. share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Link Like + Quote Reply', 'author_link': 'https://forums.macrumors.com/members/niploteksi.1061512/'}, {'date': datetime.datetime(2014, 9, 24, 0, 0), 'author': 'lowendlinux', 'body': 'lowendlinux Contributor Joined: Sep 24, 2014 Location: ~ #34 I think conscription and the draft are generally bad ideas. share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Link Like + Quote Reply', 'author_link': 'https://forums.macrumors.com/members/lowendlinux.920105/'}, {'date': datetime.datetime(2015, 7, 14, 0, 0), 'author': 'BarracksSi', 'body': "TheBean75 said: ↑ I've always been for a 2 year commitment after finishing high-school or turning 18 if you drop out.

Such service is mandatory for all males (who, as noted in another post, might find a way out with the right connections) and optional for females. They can choose to make it their long-term profession, too. Of course, you have to take into account that their relative peace with North Korea is merely a standoff. I'm of two minds with mandatory public service (whether it's shooting a rifle or wielding a broom). On one hand, there's the hope that they find an amount of respect for civil servants overall. On the other, you get some people who probably shouldn't be trusted with any sort of civic duty because they're totally incompetent. The USA is one of very few countries in the world who has an all-volunteer military. [EDIT -- okay, one out of around 100, but in the minority anyway ] Maybe we'd gain a broader sense of civic responsibility if everybody spent some time doing military work; most of my fellow veterans want to help their non-veteran civilian colleagues, not screw them over. But maybe the quality of the military would go down, too -- but saying this implies that other countries' militaries inherently suck. Some of you are saying that it's impossible to fully train soldiers for combat in a short enlistment, which is justification for the four-year enlistments we have in the US. That's partly true, but don't forget that we've been sending fresh troops into harm's way barely after they finish boot camp and infantry training. The greater complexity in military service comes when you need to lead others. Nobody fresh out of training is given the task of running an entire platoon.

I think we were justified in going to "war" in Afghanistan, we were attacked and we had the right of self-defense to go after the people that attacked us. Since the Afghan Government refused to help us capture, or kill Bin Laden and his tribe, choosing to give him aid and comfort, we really didn\'t have a choice but to invade and remove the Taliban from power.

There aren\'t, yes -- but there\'s always been people who have gotten into a career track that wasn\'t directly related to their college degrees, too. As you noted just a couple posts back, getting a sense of being a cog in the machine and helping one\'s comrades (or coworkers, or next-door neighbors) is nothing to sneeze at. I came from the music world when I got into the military (and served as a musician, too), and sometimes people asked how to reconcile the rigidity of military structure with the creative mindset of playing music. I said that the two are much more compatible than anyone expects. Very few musicians get to play whatever they want whenever they want -- that is, whatever notes they want, with any quality of sound they want, at any time or with anybody that they want (or don\'t want). There\'s a structure to music which makes it "sound good". I think it\'s hilarious that a speed metal death anarchy rock band sounds best when their execution -- tempo, ensemble cohesion, etc -- is precise and exactly together, which is totally "conformist" in its own way. The "cog in the machine", though -- the machine doesn\'t work when the cogs aren\'t any good. Just like in a car\'s transmission, all the cogs need to work together. Each individual brings their talent to enhance the entire group. The second-chair alto saxophone would ruin the section\'s sound if he didn\'t play well, so he would need to improve his skills and talent level so he can work with the group. It\'s also the group\'s responsibility to help a player grow their abilities. I\'m out of the military now, and I\'ll tell ya -- the sense of responsibility for the welfare and cohesion of the group is as necessary in the civilian sector as it always is in the military. An office worker who has that sense, even if they\'re a veteran whose job was to shoot artillery shells, is more of an asset to the organization than is a selfish clod with a BA degree. share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Link Like + Quote Reply', 'author_link': 'https://forums.macrumors.com/members/barrackssi.979715/'}, {'date': datetime.datetime(2013, 9, 10, 0, 0), 'author': 'Altis', 'body': "#40 There was a time, not long ago, when I would have supported such a thing.

Someone brand new to the forum should be able to navigate the site with ease. I do have some advice to provide an even better user experience. There should be a section on the forum with instructions on how to submit infected links, phishing sites, and malware samples to Eset. NOD 32 allows one to submit a suspicious file, false positive, or other sample from withing NOD 32 itself. Someone new to Eset may not know this though so list instructions for reporting suspicous files in the thread as well. All information related to reporting threats should be in one centralized location. Also list instructions for reporting infected links, and phishing sites to Eset. I see no where for doing this within NOD 32 itself. All instructions for reporting any type of threat should be in one centralized location.

Interesting fact, I am an out-of-practice musician (multiple instruments but mostly trumpet and guitar) and singer. I'm out of practice only in that I haven't picked up the trumpet in about 8 years and I don't pick up the guitar as much as I'd like to. Music is my soul and I'm hoping to get back into school studying music and performing again at some point. 5 Share this post Link to post Share on other sites", 'author_link': 'https://forum.eset.com/profile/5-dwomack/'}, {'date': datetime.datetime(2013, 6, 11, 0, 0), 'author': 'Void', 'body': 'Posted June 14, 2013 Hello, I am Void and I am running on Windows XP.

I am retired from teaching, but not from being an economist. I have been using NOD32 for about ten years, starting with version 2.something. My current project is setting up a new Win7sp1 64-bit Dell Precision M4700 laptop, as a replacement for my somewhat ancient Dell Latitude C840, which originally ran 32-bit Win2ksp4 and now runs 32-bit WinXPsp3. It uses NOD32 v5.2.15.0. On the assumption that I\'m now supposed to get information and help here rather than at Wilders, I wandered around this Eset Security Forum, but didn\'t find someplace where I could start a new thread to ask some questions. So I will take the liberty of doing that here. A few minutes ago, from Eset\'s website (hxxp://www.eset.com/us/download/thank-you-eav/file/8651/) I downloaded an offline Eset NOD32 v6.something. Its title is eav_nt64_enu.msi and its size is 55.5 MB (58,256,384 bytes). Given the weird title (although I am used to .msi installation files), I am not completely confident that I downloaded the offline 64-bit version. (The 64 in nt64 probably means 64-bit, but "64-bit" or "64bit" would have been more comforting.) If anyone reading this can confirm that my download is what I want (NOD32 v6.x appropriate for 64-bit Win7sp1), I would very much appreciate getting that information before I install eav_nt64_enu.msi.

And the most interesting is, that when it is explained, most of them, ....them I know of...., begins to use it. The small amount of feedback that I have, is that most people thinks, in the beginning, that it is a little bit awkward. But like many things, it is just a question about learning new habits.

Thank you ESET I agree with Janus, that many users are unaware, or have not been introduced to the technology. We need more colaborative efforts in spreading the word and making users aware about current day treats and possibilities. On average, once a week i find myself having a discussion with clients about what security measures they are taking, and why they chose what they chose. My topic leads to types of attacks and exploits that the client did not know existed or was possible, quoting " I thought that was in the movies ". We need to let people know that a strong authentication process is paramount when running online activities such as money routing and transactions, including online banking and purchasing products as well as logging into personal accounts or web portals that contain sensitive personal information. 2 Factor checking provides that extra added security for when the first is compromised, the second prevails, and also adds another step for people with malicious intent. My second choice if i could select would be " Don’t perceive any threats to their online activities " for self explanatory reasons and from my statements previously mentioned. 0 Share this post Link to post Share on other sites', 'author_link': 'https://forum.eset.com/profile/1101-arakasi/'}, {'date': datetime.datetime(2013, 5, 22, 0, 0), 'author': 'TomFace', 'body': 'Posted December 4, 2013 (edited) Janus and Arakasi are spot-on.

You enter your normal username and password to login to a server or website, and before it lets you proceed you must enter a second password to get in. ESET helps out with this by providing a mobile app that goes on your smart phone. After you pass the first username and password, it asks for another password that only can be retrieved or sent to your phone. This prevents anyone who has stolen your password to login at all because they will not have your phone to get the second password. This is the easiest way i can explain it.

(My excuse is a long boring story.) I very much appreciate your explanation of Two-Factor Authentication, and the hxxp://www.eset.com/us/business/products/secure-authentication/ link. That link made me realize that I can use Two-Factor Authentication on internet websites, but that Two-Factor Authentication is not appropriate for my end of internet connections. I do some economics consulting (mostly I am retired), but my communications with clients are by voice (in person or by land-line At&T telephone) or email. I don\'t have a website, much less a business website. For someone who has two cellphones (neither qualifying as a smart cellphone; they are roughly ten years old), I am a weirdo. Each cellphone lives in an automobile, and is used very occasionally, and only for talking. Consequently no one calls me using my cellphone numbers, because if they happened to call me on one of my cellphones (probably only my wife and me know the number; it\'s written on the back of the phone), I would eventually hear it, probably weeks later. Nevertheless, your description of how to use a smart cellphone for Two-Factor Authentication was interesting. Someday I may get a smartphone, and I am happy to know about the Eset\'s mobile app. Related different issue: I am trying to improve the security of my home office (and of using a computer when in a hotel) by installing a Virtual Private Network. When using Windows 2000 and XP, my own favorite VPN was WiFiConsulting\'s hxxp://hotspotvpn.com/, and it provided excellent protection. But I found it impossible for me to install successfully (after what I think of as trying for 100 hours or more, due to useless correspondence with WiFiConsulting) on my new Windows7 sp1 64-bit laptop, because my requests for assistance got incomplete and/or generalized answers that weren\'t specific enough for a non-geek economist (me). So I gave up. Over the past week I have been considering other VPN providers, and I tentatively have settled on Private Internet Access. I had a "chat" with one of their representatives, and asked whether Private Internet Access would interfere with Eset, or vice versa. Unfortunately he hadn\'t heard of Eset. But he said that there were some cases where security software interfered with Virtual Private Access. If any Eset user knows of any conflicts between Eset NOD32 version 7.x and Private Internet Access, please let me know. I will come back to this page in a day or so. R.N.

Re your last two lines: I don\'t think I will need to exclude filtering, given my good experience with WiFiConsulting\'s hxxp://hotspotvpn.com/ (when I was able to install it use it on Windows 2000 and XP. In any case, I\'m glad to know that on NOD32 the only filtering you can think of is http(s), pop3(s), and imap(s) protocols. SeaMonkey and my ISP (a local, redshift.com) use http(s) and pop3(s), so that\'s encouraging. Imap I\'ve heard of but never have used. The rest of this post is to let you and anyone else interested to know about some interesting VPNs. Private Internet Access is a VPN company\'s name. Annual cost: $40. It\'s "Home" website is at https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/ To get more information click on the other columns there. The most useful one (my opinion) is Contact Us, which is a collection of FAQs. Each one is separate, so I for my own use I created an "open" collection by copying each FAQ into Thornsoft\'s ClipMate, and then pasting them into Mozilla-SeaMonkey\'s HTML Composer. Some interesting reviews of Private Internet Access are: PCMagazine, at hxxp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414799,00.asp FreedomHacker, at hxxp://freedomhacker.net/private-internet-access-vpn-review/ An alternative is VikingVPN, $120 annual cost. Website is https://vikingvpn.com/ As nearly as I can see, it\'s only disadvantage is expense. But my recollection is that roughly $120 is what I paid when I was using WiFiConsulting\'s hxxp://hotspotvpn.com/, so that price isn\'t unreasonable. And it might be simpler to use than Private Internet Access is. For a very favorable review of Viking VPN, see FreedomHacker, at hxxp://freedomhacker.net/vikingvpn-review/ The prices I mention above are rounded up to the nearest dollar. Some of my efforts to decide what VPN to use are at Windows Secrets Lounge, at hxxp://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/163638-Virtual-Private-Network-%28VPN%29-Choices Roger P.S. I also considered ExpressVPN at https://www.express-vpn.com/?a_aid=zpeti, with a favorable review at https://www.bestvpn.com/blog/9405/expressvpn_review/ But my wife and I use only laptops; I don\'t use ExpressVPN\'s capabilities for multiple devices.

The site creates a web portal for everyone who wants to explore the online universe, upload interesting content and contribute to curating content for their fellow web surfers.GoExplore.net will offer exclusive interviews with high-profile Internet celebrities, how-tos, infographics and videos, as well as surveys and poll results.“Our new site, GoExplore.net, celebrates the very best of the web. We’re excited to connect with people who want to check out life beyond the first page of search and contribute to the content that’s featured for others to enjoy,” said Ignacio Sbampato, chief sales and marketing officer, ESET. “Our mission at ESET is to help people to enjoy safer technology. Our security software helps to protect customers and allows them to explore the Internet free from interruptions and malware, knowing their data is safer. We’d like to invite everyone who loves the web to become a member of the GoExplore.net community.”Recent research by GoExplore.net, revealed some interesting findings when it comes to consumer web surfing behavior. In a survey of 2,000 people in the United States and Great Britain, GoExplore.net uncovered the risks people take when surfing the web, as well as surprising behavioral differences between the sexes.According to GoExplore.net’s research, almost a quarter of American men (23.1 percent) ages 25-34 admit to using the Internet while driving a vehicle, compared to seven percent of their British counterparts. British female drivers in the same age range are twice as likely (14.3 percent) to be surfing behind the wheel.Other GoExplore.net findings include:Americans are almost three times (2.8 percent) as likely to use their smartphones at a funeral or religious service than Brits, with American women being seven times as likely to surf at a service than British women.10 percent of Internet users say they find it difficult to find what they want on the net.12.3 percent of American men ages 25-34 say they risk taking their smartphone with them to the shower or bath.About GoExplore.netGoExplore.net is an Internet initiative from security firm ESET.

And i consider myself reasonably technically proficient in MOST things. But this problem has me stumped due to (for the most part) lack of decent instructions or guidance to be found online. I am attempting to build a form for use by the employees at my company to track "signatures". we have up to now been using manually signed forms for this purpose. my goal is to go paperless with this process. I know this can be done because the Air Force (my customer) is using a form that allows you to do something similar (see here: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd2875.pdf). The before listed form allows you to "click" on the signature block and add your digital signature (which for the AF comes from a ID card). let me explain the dev environment i am using / testing on: Creating the form:I am using my personal laptop with my own personal copy of Adobe Pro 9. I have no dig signatures installed or any capacity to use them on this system. I CAN however add the field for the sig when creating the form and the field responds when clicked, although with a different prompt than the 2875 (i think this may be part of the issue). I then have tried sending the form to my AF computer to test out if it will actually allow me to add a signature block. Testing the form:On my AF computer I only have adobe reader 9 installed, and it will allow me to add my sig to the DD 2875. When i bring up my newly created form with my added sig field nothing happens at ALL when you click on it. Troubleshooting:I first noticed that under the form properties the security was set up to NOT allow signing. I changed this and sent it back over from one system to another, and it seems in the translation it loses that setting. I first assumed it might be due to the security the AF places on its email servers. So in response i burned the form to a cd and manually transferred it but recieved the same result. Conclusion:I am woefully undereducated on PDF development i suspect to understand all of what is happening here but i have a feeling there is some script attached to the AF form that works that allows it to function properly. If that is the case I am not sure what recourse i have, if any. BUT, if its something simple that im just missing because of my inexperience I am hoping someone on here can lend me a hand.

There are two ways to do this, one is to use a server, which is what the DoD does because they need to Reader Enable thousands of documents. The other way is to use Acrobat Pro (I know you said you have Pro, but for anyone else reading this has has Acrobat Standard, that version doesn\'t have the Reader Enable functionality). With the file you\'ve been working on open in Acrobat select the Advanced > Extend Features in Adobe Reader menu item.

I have had my Dell Latitude E6420 for about 5 years now but i haven't used it for about a year, It's been locked away. I decided to get it out and running again to use as a work laptop something that is easy to carry around. I hit the power button and started up fine all was running like it should, as you could imagine i had loads of updates available one was the option to update to windows 10 from the original windows 7 system. Since i have done the update to Windows 10 there is just problem after problem. My laptop keeps freezing at random points i could be doing next to nothing or i could have the laptop doing 300 activities and it will freeze either way, so i have to force shutdown the laptop by holding the power button. Then when turning on again my laptop isn't detecting my wireless mouse so i have to shutdown the laptop and turn it on again for it to pick up the mouse. Finally the speakers/sound card keeps not wanting to work without me troubleshooting the volume icon first, and then might only let me use the headphones or the speakers (volume 100% speakers don't work, put head phones in, they work. This can also happen the opposite way round speakers on 100% and work, plug headphones in, don't work???) I have something i have to mess around with everyday without a doubt. I need some software for sale or downloadable either way to fix these problems i am having with Windows 10 unless it's my computer. I will place the specs below they might help. SPECS Model: Dell Latitude E6420 RAM: 4GB Hard Drive: 1TB Processor: Intel core i5 vpro Year: Roughly 2009 If there are any more specs you need just let me know and i will add them on. Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated guys i am looking forward to talking to everyone. Thanks 1 Photo Last edited by woodward; 29th October 2016, 08:30.

I would consider a complete wipe and reinstall and see if that fixes things. If not, it may be hardware failing - for example the freezing could be associated with processor fans getting clogged with dust, in which case a good internal clean (c/o your local computer shop, possilbly?) may help. If all that fails, after 6 years, it may be time to treat yourself to a new laptop.

I found this with a Dell Vostro of the same year. Yes, different hardware but same warning on their support page about a Windows 10 upgrade. If you decide to restore to Factory Default, I have the link below for you. Just be aware that the Upgrades shall take some time and will add up.

I have an 8 year old Acer and Windows 10 runs surprisingly well on it however not all old gear likes Win10. There was a Sony Viao that the Windows Upgrade tool said "yep bubba, load it on" but the Sony support site said they were NOT making Windows 10 drivers for that model. The result was Windows 10 would install but half the hardware didn\'t have drivers. This is not an uncommon story. Woodward, if you have the time to spare try a clean install. Who knows, it might work. I would suggest a different HDD so you don\'t wipe out the Recovery Partition that is on your present HDD. Buy the wife something nice so you can justify the SSD to install in it. If it doesn\'t work then a $10 USB 3 enclosure will make a nice fast backup device for the new laptop you are considering and that will have USB3.1 SS. Backup from SSD to SSD enclosure will be mighty quick. Woodward, one last link for you to read if you want Windows 10.
