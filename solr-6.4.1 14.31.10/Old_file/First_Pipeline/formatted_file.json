When I followed 6, 6 simply led me to the same folder cited in 8, which contains only .ost files. No .pst files appear.\n\nWhen I followed 7, I arrived at F:\\Documents\\Outlook Files, but this folder was empty.\n\n[Source:] The fastest way to open the folder where your Outlook Data File (.pst and .ost) is saved is to do the following:\n[6.] I. In Outlook, click the File tab.\n  II. Click Account Settings, and then click Account Settings.\n  III.

This type of data file is also used for accounts that you set up with the Outlook Connector for Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail). Outlook Data Files (.ost) are always copies of items that are saved on a mail server and don\u2019t have to be backed up like Outlook Data Files (.pst).\n\nSource Introduction to Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost)\n\nMy computer seems to lack .pst files.\n\n\"4 (of 5) email accounts are @outlook.com, and are listed as 'Exchange ActiveSync', under 'Type'. However, these 4 are all personal accounts on my personal computer. They don't concern any servers or administrators.\n  1 (of the 5) is my work email, and is listed as 'IMAP/SMTP'.\"\n\nThis confirms that your email is using Microsoft Exchange (in the case of your work IMAP/SMTP account). The .ost files are from accounts that you have set up with the Outlook Connector for Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail). \n\nOutlook Data Files (.ost) are always copies of items that are saved on a mail server and don\u2019t have to be backed up like Outlook Data Files (.pst).\n\nThe adminstrator of your work Exchange Server (in the case of your work IMAP/SMTP account) should be responsible for backing up the server (and your emails).\nYou might like to confirm with them that backups are actually taking place.\nFor the other email accounts @outlook.com then Microsoft is the administrator of 'your email server'\n\nDo I need to backup an .ost file?\n\nSome accounts use an offline Outlook Data File (.ost). This is a synchronized copy of the messages saved on a server and that can be accessed from multiple devices and applications such as Outlook. These accounts include IMAP, Microsoft Exchange Server, and Outlook.com accounts.\nOffline Outlook Data Files are saved in\ndrive:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook. \nIt isn\u2019t necessary to back up an offline Outlook Data File (.ost) as it is a copy of the information on the server. If you set up the account again or on another computer or device, a synchronized copy of your messages are downloaded from the server.\n\nSource Create an Outlook Data File (.pst) to save your information\n\nBut I really want to backup these 4 .OST accounts\nIn this case you might like to backup the local .ost files using your normal backup program (or trust Microsoft not to mess up your accounts)\nYou can also export your mail as a .pst file by following the instructions in Exporting and Importing Mailbox Content in Outlook 2013.\nThe .pst file can then also be backed up using your normal backup program.\nThe advantage of using a .pst file is you can then import all of your email to another computer running Outlook.\nNote:\nIf you access your email account from multiple computers or devices, it\u2019s important to know that when messages are moved to an Outlook Data File (.pst) they are available only on the computer where the file is saved.\n\nClarifications as per your comments.\n\nYou wrote Microsoft Exchange (in the case of your work IMAP/SMTP account). Does this mean a Microsoft Exchange account that also runs on IMAP/SMTP?\n\nMicrosoft Exchange can be configured to support IMAP/SMTP. It could also be some other mail server that supports IMAP/SMTP. Only your work IT department can answer this question.\n\nHow do I backup .ost files? Do I just copy and paste them onto backup storage (ie an USB, external hard drive)?\n\nYou can copy and paste but it is better to use a scheduled windows backup.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know that when messages are moved to an Outlook Data File (.pst) : How can email messages be moved to a .pst?\n\nEmail messages will be moved if you create a local archive, and drag and drop emails into the local archive.\nYou can configure Outlook to automatically move your emails to the local pst file if you wish.

I'd like to move them to a newer Windows 7 PC which uses Outlook 2010.  What's the best way to do this?  Just copying the emails manually via a flash drive isn't working because the Date Created gets reset to today's date, which makes it difficult to sort through the emails.\n"}, "answer": {"answer_body": "\nWell, I am a computer technician and I do this often for customers upgrading from XP to Vista, 7 or 8. In newer Windows (Vista, 7 and 8) there in no Outlook Express and there is no way to install it, so from Microsoft Outlook 2010 you cannot import Outlook Express e-mails directly as it will complain no Outlook Express mail account found to import from. However, it can import Windows Mail (Vista) or Windows Live Mail (Vista, 7, 8) e-mails. Windows Live Mail (former Windows Mail in Vista) is part of Windows Live Essentials and can import Outlook Express e-mails directly from an Outlook Express account or from a backup. So you just install Windows Live Mail in the new PC (not necessary for Vista, use Windows Mail) and import the Outlook Express mail folder from the backup (I'll tell you how to backup it). Then you can just use Windows Live Mail, or if you prefer Microsoft Outlook 2010, you can also import the Windows Live Mail e-mails directly and use them in Microsoft Outlook. I haven't noticed the e-mail dates changing when doing all these imports, they remain the original, so there is no problem sorting the e-mails later.\nCreating a backup of the e-mails in Outlook Express at the old PC:\nTo make sure the original dates are preserved, we are not going to export the e-mails, but rather copy the original files directly from the appropriate folder. All the e-mails in Outlook Express are stored in a specific folder in files such as inbox.dbx sent.dbx etc. All you have to do is browse to the folder and copy all the files included there to another folder. The easy way is to seach for inbox.dbx and you should find it. Note: if you use non-English Windows then the file names will be at that language, eg eiserxomena.dbx for Greek, of course in Greek spelling. I have done this too many times, that it happens to know the exact path (enable hidden files as some folders are hidden). It is\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Identities\\some_long_string\\Outlook Express\nwhere username is your user name (eg Sotiris) and the some_long_string is a series of letters, but that is always different in every computer since it is created using random data when creating the mail account.\nDon't forget to search for *.wab (Windows Address Book) to find the file (eg Sotiris.wab) with your contacts and backup it too. This is (if I remember correctly) in\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Address Book\n(Note here it is only Application Data, not Local Settings\\Application Data)\nOK, we have copied all Outlook Express e-mails in another folder, now what? Importing Outlook Express e-mails into Windows Mail (Vista) or Windows Live Mail (Vista, 7, 8) :\nFrom File->Import Messages->Microsoft Outlook Express 6 and then press Next. Select Import mail form an OE6 store Directory and press OK. Now browse to the backup folder and proceed. I cannot do it right now since I don't have any Outlook Express e-mails to import, but if asked then select to import all subfolders etc. This is the procedure for Windows Mail, it should be similar for Windows Live Mail. To Import the contacts, File->Import->Windows Contacts and browse to the folder you copied the wab file.\nThat's great, but I want to use Microsoft Outlook 2010 instead. How to Import Windows Mail (or Windows Live Mail) e-mails in Outlook 2010:\nThis should be a lot easier. Go to File tab, select Open and then Import. Select Import from another program or file and click next. Select Outlook Express 4x, 5x, 6x or Windows Mail and click next. Outlook should detect Windows Mail or Windows Live Mail installed on the same computer and will import all e-mails and contacts previously imported from backup.  Now you have your old computer's Outlook Express e-mail in both Windows Mail (Windows Live Mail) and Microsoft Outlook 2010, so it's up to you which one you want to use.\nI hope that helps.\n", "answer_accepted": true, "answer_upvotes": 4}}

It is extremely powerful. At it's most simplistic use you can use \"contains\" clause for full text search that you need.\nIt gets better. The underlying SQL for your query is then also visible in a newly visible SQL tab.\nNOTE: The SQL tab is visible when creating or modifying custom views but isn't visible when just doing an \"Advanced Find\". I prefer to use custom views as a starting point for most advanced searches. Why... because I can create the SQL using the graphical tree and it does all the work of writing the code and makes no spelling mistakes. Then I save the SQL by copy paste into a text file. At any time in the future, I can just go back directly to the SQL tab and paste the saved SQL and not have to recreate it.\nExample SQL looks like this..\n(NOT(\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office#Keywords\" IS NULL)\n AND \"urn:schemas:httpmail:textdescription\" LIKE '%Outlook%'\n AND \"urn:schemas:httpmail:displayto\" LIKE '%Singh%')\n\nYou can enable it by a simple registry key, \"per user\", with these steps. No reboot is required\n\nIn regedit, navigate to registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\\nNow navigate to the subtree for your Office version number, e.g. 14.0 for 2010.\nUnder that key find Outlook, so it looks like..\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\14.0\\Outlook\nor\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Outlook\nAt the \"Outlook\" key level add a new child key called QueryBuilder.\nExit regedit.

SalesForce can take any CSV file and import it as contacts. When I export my Outlook contacts all the Japanese characters become question marks. If I import this into SalesForce the question marks remain, indicating that it's not that my editor can't show the characters, it's that the characters are really messed up (question marks in Excel, Wordpad, Notepad, Notepad++).\nTroubleshooting so far\nIf I manually change some of the question marks to the proper Japanese characters and import this into Outlook it works - indicating that SalesForce can use Unicode characters. The exported CSV file is saved as ANSI encoding, so the issue is how Outlook encodes the export.\nQuestion\nHow can I force Outlook to export the contacts as CSV with Unicode encoding? Is this an Outlook issue or is it a system setting where CSV files default back to ANSI? How could I go about changing this?\n"}, "answer": {"answer_body": "\nI was struggling the same issue with Hebrew and finally came out with this solution: \n* In (Office) Outlook add you Outlook.com account.

I had originally used a POP account, then moved over to IMAP with GoDaddy, transferring ALL my old emails over for ease of searching. Anyway, Outlook 13 was an absolute FAIL. After trying Windows Live Mail, I found it synced within 15 seconds after all the emails were downloaded initially (took FOREVER for the initial download). The only problem that I had with Windows Live Mail, the received and sent dates were listed as the day of the original upload. After some reading, found that deleting the email account from Windows Live Mail, then downloading all the emails into Thunderbird would reset the dates to the correct date, then reconfiguring the account in Windows Live Mail, the dates were now correct (still don't understand how it works, but it did). I love the ease of Windows Live Mail. It very closely mimics Outlook in both looks and feel, but without the lengthy hang-ups. I still don't understand causes Outlook to hang so severely with the IMAP folders, but I really don't care, now that I have a FAST alternative.\nI would simply suggest to anyone, just make sure all the emails are downloaded in Thunderbird BEFORE setting up the account in windows live mail. It took 5 hours for all the emails to download the first time, and that was truly 5 hours of wasted time, since I had to do it all over again anyway!!\nHope this helps someone in future searches on the issue of getting rid of the inefficiency of Outlook with IMAP servers.\nGood Luck!!\n", "answer_accepted": false, "answer_upvotes": 3}}

I realise I can probably achieve this by editing the image metadata in PhotoShop elements or similar but there ought to be a way without editing the file? This is new behaviour in Outlook 2010; 2007 didn't do this.\n"}, "answer": {"answer_body": "\nWhen you use the Insert / Picture feature to insert an inline image, Outlook (and other MS apps such as Word and Excel) will look at the DPI setting in the image file. If your picture has a DPI setting of anything other than 96, Outlook will resize (i.e., scale and resample) your image (permanently) to 96 DPI upon insertion and there isn't much you can do about it after the fact.\nThe way to avoid this problem altogether is to open the image in a good image editor, set the DPI value to 96 DPI, and then save the image. If you do not resample the image when you do this, a good image editor will in no way affect the actual image content (i.e., it will remain pixel for pixel identical). After you do this, when you insert the image into an Outlook e-mail, Outlook will show it (and send it) in its original size, unless you manually resize / scale it. This is how you avoid the gratuitous \"Outlook scaling, blurring, and destroying your pristine image,\" issue.\nSearching for ways to resolve this problem took me quite a bit of time and effort. I would like to thank the following informative web site for describing both the origin of this problem and its solution: \nImage resizes and becomes unsharp upon sending.\nUpdate: The 96 dpi mentioned in my answer above is not fixed. In Windows, you can choose to set the DPI value to other settings using for example, Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > Display in Windows 7. This change affects the DPI value that MS Office products use. \nIf your text size is set to something other than \"Smaller\" (i.e., 100% / 96 DPI), you will have to use a DPI setting other than 96 DPI, depending on the text scaling factor you have set. This is especially true on laptops where people tend to use larger text settings, because their screens are much smaller (often set this way right out of the factory). For example, if you are using Medium size text (i.e., 125% of the 96 DPI value), your images will have to have their DPI setting changed to 120 in order not to get rescaled/resampled when inserted into Outlook. \nThe moral of the story is that if you use 96 DPI and see that your inserted images are still coming out blurry, check your Text Size settings in Windows and adjust the DPI value accordingly.\n", "answer_accepted": true, "answer_upvotes": 23}}

For the third one, it might need another answer as mobile devices' behaviour might vary.\nSimple Answer\nBefore we go on, let me say that if you switched from IMAP to POP3, then Adam Thomson's answer will be sufficient for you :)\nOr would you rather read on...\nIMAP is supposed to work by syncing folders that you have subscribed (optionally: with your own custom filter) which is done ideally in near real-time. Outlook 2013 might have the tendency to guarantee this behaviour, ignoring the Send/Receive rules you may have set. But, Working Offline seems to break this behaviour (or rather, Outlook's IMAP-syncing obeys the Work Offline's dictatorship).\nIf you are alright with switching to Work Offline mode for eternity, then please continue...\nSwitch to Work Offline. Done! Now we need a method to Send/Receive in offline mode. But only to send, not to receive.\nBefore you are too worried facing the doom of working offline forever (or rejoice!--if your job is to answer those never-ending corporate emails), let me tell you that while working offline... you can still Send/Receive your emails! (OH NO!!)\nSeriously, just tick Include this group in send/receive (F9) checkboxes in both Online and Offline category in the Define Send/Receive Groups settings window, also tick Schedule an automatic send/receive every XX minutes in both section, and also lowering the XX minutes to something lower, let's say 10 minutes while you're at it. (Note that this is not actually the best use for these options.)\nNow, have you defined your own Send/Receive Groups yet? No? Great! Click the Edit button! Yes, you say? You have set a custom group for your IMAP-enabled account? Doesn't matter! Select it, and then click the Edit button! Remember to check the other groups later, because what matters most is on the inside.\nInside, pick the email account you want (if there is only one then it will be much much easier). Make sure you tick the main checkbox called Include the selected account in this group.\nIn the Account Options group box, tick Send mail items (so that you can send emails, duh), and untick Receive mail items (this is actually important). Untick other checkboxes as necessary.\nRegarding those two checkboxes, let me add something mind-blogging for you a bit:\n\nYou can still send mails with Send mail items option unticked, while offline, by issuing commands:\n\n\nSend/Receive All Folders (F9) (if the group's Offline option Include this group in send/receive (F9) is ticked)\nSend All (always)\nUpdate Folder (when in the Outbox folder)\n\nYou will still receive mails with Receive mail items option unticked, while offline, by issuing commands:\n\n\nSend/Receive All Folders (F9) (if the group's Offline option Include this group in send/receive (F9) is ticked, and the group's Include the selected account in this group is ticked for the email account)\nSend/Receive (Inbox) (always)\nUpdate Folder (when in the Inbox or other incoming folders)\n\n\nJust like what they said, all roads lead to Rome. But Rome here is actually what we don't want to reach. So what more can we do?\nFEAR NOT! FOR THERE IS A SECRET I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU YET. SPOILER ALERT!!!\nI have told you, what matters most is on the inside. QUICK! To that Edit button again!\nNow you see, inside the inner Send/Receive group setting, in the Folder Options group box, there stand those shiny folders, ready for you to tick/untick. UNTICK THEM ALL. These tickmarks have been responsible for all of your grueling lifeless nights. They are the source of reason of why the Outlook IMAP demon behave like this. (Tick = sync folder. Untick = do not sync.)\nLet us summarize...\nDisable folder auto-sync\n\nSwitch to Work Offline, and remain like this forever as necessary.\nOpen Define Send/Receive Groups options window.\nWhen Outlook is Offline: tick Include this group in send/receive (F9).\nWhen Outlook is Offline: tick Schedule an automatic send/receive every XX minutes and other options as necessary.\nGroup item: Edit to open Send/Receive Account Setting.\nTick Send mail items.\nUntick Receive mail items and other options as necessary.\nUntick all folders if you don't want Outlook to auto-sync any of them.\n\nSend emails\n\nSend/Receive All Folders (F9).\nOr just wait if you have scheduled it to run even when working offline.\n\nCheck emails on demand\n\nSend/Receive (Inbox).\nUpdate Folder (when in the Inbox or other incoming folders).\n\nThat's it.

This issue may occur if all of the following conditions\n  are true: The email message is sent to you by someone using Microsoft\n  Outlook. The format of the message is Rich Text format (RTF).\nThis issue is more common when the email message is sent to you over\n  the Internet. \nCAUSE\nThe Winmail.dat file is used to\n  preserve Rich Text formatting. Outlook uses it when sending a Rich\n  Text-formatted message. During transport, the content of the message\n  may be changed, preventing the receiving client from being able to\n  read the formatting instructions. In other cases, the receiving client\n  does not use or recognize the winmail.dat file.\nRESOLUTION\nThe data in a winmail.dat file is not usable. To resolve\n  this issue, ask the sender to re-send the message in plain text\n  format. The following methods can be used by sender to prevent sending\n  Rich Text messages encapsulated in the Transport Neutral Encapsulation\n  Format (TNEF).\nMethod 1: Change the default message format \nThe sender can change the\n  format of the email messages that they send by using the following\n  steps:   On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click Mail Format.\n  In Compose in this message format, click to select Plain Text, and\n  then click OK. NOTE: To send to certain recipients that use RTF format\n  and others recipients that use plain text format, the sender must set\n  the option for the recipient in either the Personal Address Book or\n  the recipient's contact record.\nMethod 2: Modify the recipient's entry in the Personal Address Book \nThe sender can use the following steps to remove the RTF format from\n  the recipient attribute in the Personal Address Book:   On the Tools\n  menu, click Address Book. In Show Names From, click the Personal\n  Address Book. Select the addressee that you want to set as plain text,\n  and then click Properties on the File menu. In the SMTP-General tab,\n  click to clear the Always send to this recipient in Microsoft Exchange\n  rich text format check box, and then click OK.\nMethod 3: Change the specific contact format \nThe sender can use the\n  following steps to set plain text in the recipient's contact record:\n  Open the recipient's record in the Contacts folder. Double-click the\n  recipient's e-mail address. In the E-Mail Properties dialog box, click\n  Send Plain Text only under Internet Format.\nMethod 4: Set the Outlook Rich Text Format Internet e-mail setting \nIn\n  Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007, click Options on the Tools menu.
