## crawler

- is_results_page: very slow needed optimising
- doesn't work if threads have pagination (i.e. lots of posts)
- need to build isValidSite
- distinguish blog pages and results pages

- pagination links and result links often to large
- nested posts

- if/user/ or /member/ in url then nearly always user or member page !
